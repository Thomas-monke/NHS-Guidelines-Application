# NHS Guidelines Application

This unofficial application is designed for NHS Doctors and Clinicians to view guidelines for specific conditions. These guidelines are stored in a database and are created by System Authors who use the built in features of the app to create consistently styled guidelines. These are then checked and approved by External Auditors, who can make changes to the guidelines.

## Application GUI

**Here are some wireframes for what we think the finished product should look like:**

| Wireframe | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![Home page first step on a mobile device](Images/MobileHomepage.png "Home page first step on a mobile device") | Figure 1: Guidelines homepage on a mobile phone. This is the first page that the user will see if they successfully login to the app. A carousel method is used to navigate between different categories of guidelines. |
| ![Home page user settings on a mobile device](Images/MobileHomepage2.png "Home page user settings on a mobile device") | Figure 2:  User settings on the guidelines homepage. The user can either logout and return to the login page or they can access the settings page of the app where they can change the appearance of the app to improve accessibility. |
| ![Home page hamburger menu on a mobile device](Images/MobileHomepage3.png "Home page hamburger menu on a mobile device") | Figure 3: The guidelines homepage with an extended hamburger menu. The menu shows the different categories of guidelines that the user can visit while providing options to logout of the app, view the settings and search for specific guidelines. |
